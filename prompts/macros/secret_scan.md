🚨 **SECURITY AUDIT** 🚨
Please scrutinize the diff for any potential secrets, API keys, credentials, or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) that may have been accidentally committed.
If you find any, flag them as **CRITICAL** severity issues immediately.
Common patterns to look for: `API_KEY`, `password`, `secret`, `token`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`.
