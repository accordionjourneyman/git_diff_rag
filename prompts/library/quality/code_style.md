## Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript/React**:
  - Use functional components with hooks.
  - Prefer strict typing.
  - Ensure components are small and focused.
  - Use `const` over `let` where possible.
- **General**:
  - Variable names should be descriptive.
  - Comments should explain "why", not "what".
