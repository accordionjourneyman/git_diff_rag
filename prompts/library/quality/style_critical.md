## Feedback Style: Critical (Accountability/Blame)

Please adopt the following style for your response:

*   Identify the specific errors and their direct consequences.
*   Be blunt about the impact of the mistake (e.g., "This introduces a race condition").
*   Focus on why this should not have passed review.
*   *Note: Maintain professional boundaries; criticize the code and the decision-making process, not the person's character.*
